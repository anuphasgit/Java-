# Project 1: MusicList Analyzer

* Author: Anup Bhattarai
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2022

## Overview

This program inputs track information from user, converts each track playtime from minutes to seconds,
then creates three different track objects. It also calculates the average play time of three tracks, 
identifies the track closest to 180 seconds and creates a sorted music list and prits it.

## Reflection

For me personally completing this project was a smoother experience compared to the previous project. I found the instuctions were more straightforward which allowed me to complete it in way less time thas the last project. The project concepts were quiet clear to me, but I did face some challenges when it came to remembering the basic syntax. Luckily, I referred back to code that I had written in the class activities.
To make my code easier to modify and follow along I used meaningful variable names that described the data they were representing. This project was a valuable learning experience and by completing it I am confident about the concepts used and their associated syntax.

## Compiling and Using


Open a terminal and type the following command in the project01 directory.
$javac MusicList.java


Now that you have created java class file for the project type the following command:
$java MusicList

After you run the program you will be asked for value of album, artist, title and playtime of the track.
Once you enter all the values for three tracks you will recieve the output on your screen.
