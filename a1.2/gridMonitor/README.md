Overview:

GridMonitor program reads file from a file and performs different calculations to determine wether a cell is in danger of exploding or not. 
GridMonitorDriver is the driver class for this program which reads the grid data from a file and performs calculations to give an output if the cell is in the risk of exploding or not. 


INCLUDED FILES:

GridMonitor.java
GridMonitorInterface.java
GridMonitorTest.java
GridMOnitorDriver.java
README.md

COMPILING AND RUNNING:

To compile the progrm GridMonitorTest, run the following command in the project folder:

$ javac GridMonitorTest.java

To run the program run:

$ java GridMonitorTest

After running the program you will be prompted to enter the name of the file containing grid data for calculation. If the file you entered is valid the program performs the calculation and gives an output in grid format either true or false. True means the cell is in danger to explode and false means it is safe. If the file you entered doesnot exist you will be prompted with a file not found comment. 


REFLECTION:

This warmup project was a valuable tool to memorize the concepts of programming learned in CS121, as I had already forgotten most of it. I had struggled in the final project of CS121 so I was initially concerned when the professor described it being simmilar in complexity to the final project of CS121. But, suprisingly I found that it was not as challenging as the final project from the spring semester. One of the major struggle during this project was understanding syntax of various methods. I had to go back to my projects from CS121 quiet often to help me out. Apart from this, everything worked out well during the project.
