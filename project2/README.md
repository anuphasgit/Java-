JukeboxHero

##Overview 

JukeboxHero is a java program that allows a user to load a catalog of songs from a text file,search the catalog for specific songs, analyze the catalog and print the catalog. This program uses an Arraylist to hold and manage Song objects.


##Reflection

Doing this project was a great learning experience which made me confident on using ArrayLists and nested loops. To make my coding process easier and organized I used appropriate variable names and commented my code at parts which helped me when I had to come back to make an edit. I found the use of nested loops a bit challenging in this project. I had to spend some time learning the syntax of loops and fixing the issues that caused my program to output same outputs repeatedly.
If I could change anything about the design process I would probably make an outline for how my code will look like, which I belive would have saved my time since I had to go back to the code and make changes quiet frequently. If I could go back in time I would tell myself to start early and work on the assignent everyday rather than leaving everything for the last moment.

##Compiling and Using

To compile the program, run javac "JukeboxHero.java" in the command line. To run the program, run "java JukeboxHero".
After running the program, a menu will be displayed on the screen with options to load, search, analyze and print the catalog. The prompt will be displayed to guide the user throughout the process.
