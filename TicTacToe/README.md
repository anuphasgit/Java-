## Overview
This project is a simple game of TicTacToe. This game consists of two players(O and X). The first player to get three marks in a row (i.e diagonally, vertically or horizontally) wins the game. 

## Reflection
If I could go back to time I would tell myself to start early and work on the project consistantly rather than doing everything at the very end.

## Compiling and Running
To compile the program run,
javac *.java in the command line. This creates class file for the java files you have.
Now to run the program run,
TicTacToeTester.java in the command line to see if all the tests pass for TicTacToeGUI or not.
To play the game run,
TicTacToeGUI.java inthe command line, which runs a TictacToe game in a new window. Now, you can start choosing your move in the grid of the game using the mouse pointer. Remember the first player to get three marks(either X or O) in a row (i.e diagonally, vertically or horizontally) wins the game. The game will show the moves, displays the winner or if the game is a tie in the right side of the game window. Enjoy the tictactoe game!!
