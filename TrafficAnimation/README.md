# Project #: Project 0 (Traffic Animation)

* Author: Anup Bhattarai
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2023

## Overview

This code animates an object moving in the screen and surrounding made by using graphic class.


## Reflection

This project made me confident using graphic class in java. I already knew the way to display different shapes
in Java so drawing the surrounding and object did not take much time. But, the problem that I faced while 
doing this assignment was I had supposed a unit and made my animation with respect to the unit. I did not 
think of resizing the window unless I completed my project. But, when I resized it my animation would fly here 
and there. I still do not know what worked wrong because I supposed the unit with respect to height and width. 
There is nothing in particular that I want to change about my design process. The only thing that I would do
will be running my program quiet frequently and resizing the window everytime I drew something.


## Compiling and Using

Open a terminal and type the following command in the p0 directory
$javac TrafficAnimation.java


Now that you have created java class file for the project type the following command:
$java TrafficAnimation
